# 🌟 Getting Started with Your Project Site

This is a template site for your **Final Quest** project. You’ll use it to track your progress, reflect on your work, and share your final product. You’re free to modify the content, layout, and style as long as it stays in a GitHub repository and includes your required blog posts.

**READ THIS THROUGH ONCE BEFORE YOU GET STARTED!**

### Step 1) Create a GitHub Account

Go to github.com and sign up for a free account. Choose a username you’re okay sharing in a public URL (e.g., myusername).

### Step 2) Copy This Template to Your Account

1.	Sign in to GitHub.
2.	Visit this repository.
3.	Click the “Fork” button in the top-right corner. This creates a copy of the site under your own GitHub account.

### Step 3) Rename Your Repository

1.	In your forked copy (should be myusername/final-chronicle-template), click on Settings.
2.	Rename the repo to:
	myusername.github.io
	(Replace myusername with your GitHub username exactly.)
3.	Scroll down to GitHub Pages section.
	* Set the source to main.
	* Hit save.

### Step 4) Customize Your Site

Edit the [_config.yml](./_config.yml) file to change your site’s name, description, and avatar.

**To do this:**  
* Click [_config.yml](./_config.yml) in the file list.  
* Click the ✏️ icon (top right) to edit.  
* Change the values under title, description, and avatar.  
* Scroll down and click Commit changes to save.  


**To add your own image:**  
* Click on the [images/](./images/) folder.  
* Click Add File → Upload files, then drag in your image (e.g., myphoto.png).  
* Commit the change.  
* Update the avatar line in [_config.yml](./_config.yml) to:  
		https://myusername.github.io/images/myphoto.png  
* Commit the change!  

Your website should appear within a few minutes at:
🔗 https://myusername.github.io

Making a change to [_config.yml](./_config.yml) (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable within 5 minutes at <https://myusername.github.io>.


### Step 5) Write Your First Blog Post

1.	Click into the [_posts/](./_posts/)  folder.
2.	Edit the file called 2025-05-07-motivation.md
3.	Answer the questions in the template using Markdown. https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
4.	Commit the change!

#### ✍️ To Add More Posts
* Click [_posts/](./_posts/)  → Add File → Create new file
* Find the file named something like YYYY-MM-DD-day-1.md.
* Click the three dots (⋯) next to it and select “Copy” or “Duplicate” (or click into the file and use “Edit → Copy file”).
* Rename the new file with the correct date, like:
		2025-05-10-day-2.md
* Fill in your content using the prompts in the copied template.

✅ Important:
Make sure the new filename follows the format:
year-month-day-title.md (e.g., 2025-05-10-day-2.md)
This is how Jekyll knows to treat it as a blog post.


### Step 6) Your Final Blog Post

1.	Click into the [_posts/](./_posts/)  folder.
2.	Edit the file called 2025-05-23-tip.md
3.	Answer the questions in the template using Markdown. https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
4.	Commit the change!
