### What I Set Out to Do

The first work day of my project, I set out to lay as much groundwork as possible to create the Blackjack game. I wanted to go as far as I could before encountering major bugs, which I might treat at a later time.

---

### What I Actually Did

I used code from previous trainings to create a deck and then shuffle it. I set up the rules of the game which would be printed when running the game. I established the hands for the user and the dealer, popping the card each time. I set up an input so the user could say Hit or Stand and add to their hand accordingly. I realized that I needed a separate function to count the value of the user's hand and another to count the value of the dealer's hand.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I noticed that the best way to deal the cards would be to model them like real life; add a card to a hand while also removing it from the deck. I considered having a system that used indexing, but adding the first card and then popping it was the simplest system. I learned that the next stage of the project would consist of making separate count_user functions and cound_dealer functions because the way to treat them is different.

### What's Next

I plan to work on the separate count_user and count_dealer functions to later incorporate into the main function.
