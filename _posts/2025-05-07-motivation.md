### Project Focus


My project is an interactive simulation of the classic card game Blackjack. I chose not to include a betting system, but the user goes through the same set of choices with the same set of information as in a typical Blackjack game. I wanted to add another element to the project by trying to code it in Ruby. In this way, the project is interesting for its game design and pushes me to explore other coding languages as well.

### Why This Project 

I was immediately drawn to doing this type of project due to my love for all sorts of card games. My favorite card game is Poker, but it is a much more complex game that is more heavily reliant on betting than blackjack. Although I do not usually play Blackjack, it seemed more realistic both for the game design and game complexity. It could be modified to just the user and computer, and the betting system was left out.

### What I Want to Learn

Through this question I wanted to reinforce my skills with simple game design. My code relies heavily on conditional statements and input from the user to make certain choices (such as to Hit or Stand after seeing their cards). My game is also broken up into multiple functions, so I am practicing breaking up a problem down into smaller chunks. Through the translational aspect of my project I'll learn how to use online resources to create code. The whole project will require a lot of patience and debugging.  


### My Approach 


The first week I will focus on creating a functional Blackjack code in Python. This way I will have a code to reference when translating it to Ruby, and I will also have a game to present if the translation proves unsuccessful. The second half of the project will be dedicated to translating my multiple functions into Ruby. However I will prioritize making a functional code of the game in the first place. I will be finished when I have created a functional Blackjack game in Python and gone as far as I could in translating it to Ruby.

### What's Next

In the first stage of my project I plan to rely on previous code to set up the cards for Blackjack. Next I will create code to simulate the game itself in Python.
