### Project Focus

[What kind of project are you planning to build? Give it a working title and briefly describe what it is (e.g., a game, simulation, interactive story). What makes it interesting or challenging?]

---

### Why This Project 

[What drew you to this idea? How does it connect to something you’re interested in—whether in or outside of class? Why is this the right project for *you* to work on right *now*?]

---

### What I Want to Learn

[What programming concepts do you want to strengthen through this project (e.g., functions, conditionals, loops, data structures)?  
Beyond coding, what personal or creative skills are you hoping to build—like debugging, problem solving, design, or perseverance?]



### My Approach 

[How do you plan to structure your time over the next two weeks? What will you focus on first? What will you prioritize later?  
What does “done enough” look like to you—and how will you decide when to stop polishing?]

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
